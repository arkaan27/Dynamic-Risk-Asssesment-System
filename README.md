## Dynamic Risk Assessment System
With an assumption that we have a Machine Learning model in production, the project
aims to check in regular intervals (per crontab configuration) for new datasets
and acts upon any new data that is saved. 
The model is tested for checking whether model drift, re-train if needed 
and new reporting of the model performance, data quality and timing of execution 
is saved to the database.

This project is part of Udacity nanodegree program.
